================We lost the flag==================

LOST .PNG  =====> IS PROBLEM
LOST 2.png

References "file signatures" (hinting to check file headers).

LOST 3.png & LOST 3A.png

Show hex dumps of a file named lost (1).png with JFIF markers.

Likely another corrupted JPEG/PNG hybrid.

LOST 4.png (Hex Data)

Starts with FF DB FF E8 (non-standard JPEG header; should be FF D8 FF E0).

Contains JFIF (JPEG metadata) and strange decoded text (MOVE...JFIF).

Corrupted header (try fixing to FF D8 FF E0).

Hidden data (e.g., appended files, steganography).

FLAG4.png

Contains the text: CIT{using_m4glc_1t_s33m5}

This is likely a fake flag or a hint pointing to "magic numbers" (file signatures).

The flag suggests using file command or hex analysis (e.g., JFIF = JPEG signature).
